    ///   (at least, it's highly likely to be incorrect if it wasn't).
    /// * `T` needs to have the same size and alignment as what `ptr` was allocated with.
    ///   (`T` having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment really
    ///   needs to be equal to satisfy the [`dealloc`] requirement that memory must be
    ///   allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)
    /// * `length` needs to be less than or equal to `capacity`.
    /// * `capacity` needs to be the capacity that the pointer was allocated with.
    ///
    /// Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator's
    /// internal data structures. For example it is **not** safe
    /// to build a `Vec<u8>` from a pointer to a C `char` array with length `size_t`.
    /// It's also not safe to build one from a `Vec<u16>` and its length, because

    /// alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2 (for `u16`), but after
    /// turning it into a `Vec<u8>` it'll be deallocated with alignment 1.
